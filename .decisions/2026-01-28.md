[15:05] Add pairing orchestration tracing and document command trace standard

- Why: Ensure pairing flows emit consistent trace spans and document the required trace pattern for commands
- Risk: none
  [15:51] Improve pairing usecase and protocol test coverage
- Why: Raise coverage in low-tested pairing/network modules and ensure safe device naming behavior
- Risk: none
  [16:28] Remove direct deps access in pairing spans
- Why: Enforce command-layer access rules by avoiding runtime.deps in Tauri commands
- Risk: device_id is no longer recorded for these two spans
