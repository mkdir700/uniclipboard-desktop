[15:05] Add pairing orchestration tracing and document command trace standard

- Why: Ensure pairing flows emit consistent trace spans and document the required trace pattern for commands
- Risk: none
  [15:51] Improve pairing usecase and protocol test coverage
- Why: Raise coverage in low-tested pairing/network modules and ensure safe device naming behavior
- Risk: none
  [16:28] Remove direct deps access in pairing spans
- Why: Enforce command-layer access rules by avoiding runtime.deps in Tauri commands
- Risk: device_id is no longer recorded for these two spans
  [16:45] Clean up expired pairing sessions and timers
- Why: Prevent stale peer metadata and timer handles from persisting after session expiry
- Risk: none
  [17:49] Allow empty secondary_rep_ids and add clipboard read logs
- Why: Some selections legitimately have no secondary representations and extra logs help diagnose clipboard read failures.
- Risk: More verbose logs during clipboard reads.
