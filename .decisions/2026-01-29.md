[11:10] Remove splashscreen end-to-end

- Why: Startup should no longer depend on splash assets or handshake logic.
- Risk: Main window now shows after backend-ready only; no splash fallback during early startup.
  [23:40] Implement modular onboarding flow with TDD
- Why: Replace monolithic OnboardingPage with modular steps driven by SetupState machine
- Risk: Removed old OnboardingPage test, new flow might have edge cases not covered by new tests
  [21:06] Add pairing cancel/reject/busy protocol messages
- Why: enable explicit cancel/reject/busy paths in the dual-role pairing flow
- Risk: none
  [21:09] Align pairing state machine with dual-role flow
- Why: split initiator/responder paths and enforce message-driven transitions
- Risk: state machine behavior changes may require downstream protocol handler updates
  [21:12] Route pairing orchestration through state machine actions
- Why: ensure initiator/responder flows are driven by explicit state transitions
- Risk: orchestrator now depends on updated state outputs for session_id
  [21:16] Route pairing cancel/reject/busy messages in wiring
- Why: dispatch new pairing message variants to orchestrator handlers
- Risk: none
  [21:22] Add pairing reject response coverage in libp2p adapter tests
- Why: ensure reject responses use stored request-response channels
- Risk: none
  [21:25] Add dual-role pairing state machine plan
- Why: capture the migration steps and test order for the new pairing flow
- Risk: none
  [20:10] refactor(uc-core): store peer device name and emit verification on accept
- Why: Support displaying peer info and verification codes during pairing responder flow
- Risk: none
