[20:23] Normalize superset setup command

- Why: Keep setup command format consistent for local tooling
- Risk: none

[20:26] Set UNICLIPBOARD_ENV for dev scripts

- Why: Ensure dev tooling uses the same environment flag expected by runtime behavior
- Risk: none

[20:32] Allow macOS dev env file keystore

- Why: Allow development setups to bypass Keychain friction while keeping production defaults

[23:58] Split setup onboarding and security changes into atomic commits

- Why: Keep security redaction, tauri wiring, API, UI, and docs reviewable independently
- Risk: none

[23:59] Update onboarding plan docs for setup state machine

- Why: Document setup flow changes and reference new plan
- Risk: none

[00:00] Redact setup passphrases in Debug output

- Why: Prevent passphrase values from appearing in setup dispatch logs
- Risk: none

[00:01] Add setup command wiring in tauri runtime

- Why: Expose setup state machine commands to the frontend
- Risk: none

[00:02] Add setup flow integration test

- Why: Cover setup orchestrator create-space flow with integration test
- Risk: none

[00:03] Add setup API DTOs and dispatch helpers

- Why: Provide frontend access to setup state machine commands
- Risk: none

[00:04] Add modular onboarding step components

- Why: Break onboarding UI into reusable step components matching setup flow
- Risk: none

[00:05] Wire onboarding page to setup state flow

- Why: Render correct step components and dispatch setup events
- Risk: none
  [18:12] Redesign onboarding UI with i18n-backed copy
- Why: Make the onboarding flow clearer while enabling locale switching without duplicating UI logic
- Risk: UI regressions in step transitions/spacing; missing translation keys could surface as fallback text

[18:12] Document onboarding i18n migration plan

- Why: Capture key conventions and verification steps to keep follow-ups consistent and reviewable
- Risk: none
  [2026-01-30 20:54] Ignore Rust target artifacts
- Why: prevent Rust build outputs from polluting git status
- Risk: none
  [2026-01-30 20:54] Improve onboarding welcome card affordance
- Why: strengthen visual separation and hover feedback for primary actions
- Risk: none
  [2026-01-30 20:54] Add breathing room between passphrase label and input
- Why: reduce cramped label/input spacing in onboarding
- Risk: none
  [2026-01-30 20:55] Loosen password mask spacing on macOS
- Why: improve legibility of password dots while keeping placeholder normal
- Risk: minor visual change across password inputs
  [23:05] Remove unused mock counter in setup tests
- Why: Avoid dead-code warning under -D warnings in test build
- Risk: none

[23:36] Redact setup pass1/pass2 in telemetry

- Why: Prevent passphrase fields from leaking into Sentry breadcrumbs
- Risk: none

[07:59] Remove global pairing dialogs and fix receiver accept/PIN UX

- Why: Avoid conflicting listeners and ensure receiver-side pairing actions and PIN UI behave consistently on Devices page.
- Risk: Pairing requests are no longer shown globally; users must be on the Devices page to see/accept them. No automated tests run.
  [2026-01-30 08:39] Align SAS ordering and emit pairing verifying state
- Why: Ensure initiator/responder compute the same short authentication string and surface an explicit verifying UI state during response handling
- Risk: Frontend must recognize the new "verifying" event kind; otherwise it will be ignored
  [2026-01-30 08:39] Handle pairing verifying event in frontend
- Why: Surface backend verifying progress event in Devices page so users see explicit state instead of waiting silently
- Risk: none
