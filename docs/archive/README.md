# Archive

This directory contains historical planning and implementation documents that have been superseded by the new documentation structure.

## Contents

### plans/

Historical planning documents from the architecture migration (Clean Architecture → Hexagonal Architecture). These documents detail the step-by-step implementation process.

**For current architecture documentation, see**: [../README.md](../README.md)

### testing/

Historical test plans and testing documentation.

**For current testing information, see**: [../guides/error-handling.md](../guides/error-handling.md) and [../standards/coding-standards.md](../standards/coding-standards.md)

## When to Use These Documents

- Understanding the **history** of architectural decisions
- Researching **why** certain approaches were taken
- Learning from **implementation challenges** encountered during migration
- **Historical context** during code review

## When NOT to Use These Documents

- For **current architecture rules** → Use [../architecture/](../architecture/)
- For **implementation guidance** → Use [../guides/](../guides/)
- For **coding standards** → Use [../standards/](../standards/)

## Migration Timeline

- **2025-01-12**: Initial architecture design documents
- **2026-01-12**: Bootstrap module design and implementation
- **2026-01-13**: Phase 2-4 implementation completion
- **2026-01-13**: Documentation restructure (plans → archive)

## Current Documentation

The new documentation structure is organized by purpose, not by implementation timeline:

- **[../README.md](../README.md)** - Main documentation hub
- **[../overview.md](../overview.md)** - Project overview and architecture
- **[../architecture/](../architecture/)** - Architecture principles and design
- **[../guides/](../guides/)** - How-to guides for common tasks
- **[../standards/](../standards/)** - Coding standards and conventions
